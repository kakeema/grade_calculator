# grade_calculator
A calculator for calculating a students overall award classification.

Depending on when you are viewing this, the database may not be existing anymore.

You must also enable the PDO MySQL driver in a Windows environment (or whichever environment you are on) if you already haven't, otherwise you will run into some PHP error.

You must also be in a server, if you use your own server and database then you must change the username, password, database name etc., in the db.php file in the model foder. Otherwise you can access the website through this link https://kunet.uk/k2230216/grade_calculator/index.html
